Let‚Äôs jump in.

3.  Let Notion AI turn it into a neat, easy-to-read summary.

Bonus: Use flashcard templates in Notion to turn your summaries into quick quizzes.

[Hack #2 ‚Äì ChatGPT: The Smartest Study Buddy]

[Hack #3 ‚Äì Forest App: Gamify Your Focus Time]
Tool: Forest
If your phone distracts you every time you try to study, this one‚Äôs for you.
What It Does:
Forest uses the Pomodoro technique ‚Äî 25 minutes of focus followed by a short break. The twist? Every time you focus, you grow a virtual tree. Leave the app early, and the tree dies.
How to Use:
1.  Open the app.
2.  Set a timer (e.g., 25 minutes to revise a chapter).
3.  Stay in the app until your timer ends.
Example: At the end of the week, you can look at your ‚Äúproductivity forest‚Äù and see how much focus time you‚Äôve built up.

How to Use:

2.  Record yourself explaining a topic or summarizing a lecture.
3.  Audiopen converts your recording into clear paragraphs.
Example: Instead of typing notes after class, just speak your thoughts into your phone while walking home. The AI will clean it up for you.

1.  Add your tasks for the day (e.g., ‚ÄúRead Chapter 5,‚Äù ‚ÄúPractice Python coding‚Äù).
2.  Start a 25-minute timer, take a 5-minute break, repeat.
